# Privacy Policy

I donâ€™t store your data, period.

There are no accounts local to Jotify nor does Jotify ask for any of your information when you download the app. Jotify does not have any dedicated servers, instead opting to store data on closed containers in the CloudKit platform. All notes are stored on private servers inaccessible by myself or others. Data is also stored locally on device, but this can be removed at user's discretion by deleting the app.

### Security

I value your trust through using my app so, I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
